By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

If there is any instruction, function, or addition that is not clear to you, please ask questions to fully understand the idea and ensure clarity.

Any new function or entity should be added while considering the current architecture defined in 'ARCHITECTURE.md'.

Pay close attention to the syntax and imports when making adjustments, extractions, or migrations in the code.
