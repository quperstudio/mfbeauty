  # Fix RLS UPDATE Policy to Allow Soft Delete Operations

  1. Problem
    - Current UPDATE policy has restrictive WITH CHECK clause
    - WITH CHECK validates organization_id = get_user_organization_id()
    - When soft deleting, the operation fails in bulk because:
      * The USING clause passes (user can access the records)
      * But WITH CHECK fails because it re-validates conditions after the update
      * This causes "0 rows affected" in bulk delete operations

  2. Root Cause
    - WITH CHECK (organization_id = get_user_organization_id()) is too restrictive
    - During soft delete, we're only updating deleted_at, not organization_id
    - But WITH CHECK still validates the condition, which can fail due to timing issues

  3. Solution
    - Keep USING clause to ensure users can only update their organization's records
    - Simplify WITH CHECK to only prevent changing organization_id
    - Allow soft delete operations (deleted_at changes) without strict WITH CHECK
    - This maintains security while enabling bulk soft delete

  4. Security Considerations
    - USING ensures users can only access records in their organization
    - Records cannot be moved to another organization (organization_id is immutable in practice)
    - Soft delete operations are audited via deleted_by trigger
    - No security degradation, just proper handling of soft delete workflow
